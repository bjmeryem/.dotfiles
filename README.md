### This is a highly rewarding config for your shell and Vim at 1337 school, for poolers and students, with many useful aliases, Vim plugins, etc.

<be>

> This includes aliases to setup Oh-My-Zsh, 42 Cformatter, Move_to_goinfre... etc.\
> If you're good at shell config, you can read the files and explore things\
> Otherwise, please Don't be shy to [reach out to me](https://wa.me/212641134341) for help\
> Please don't share it widely. Only share it with someone you can help set everything up\
> Good luck!

### The How-to:

<br>

> Explore the aliases; use the ones that set or install something (the second alias group)\
> Open `vi test.c`, execute `:PlugInstall` and check that everything is Ok.\
> Write in the test.c file some C code, then save with `:w` to check whether C_formatter_42 will work correctly\
> You can add your configs in $df/.personal, if you wish to keep them separate from `.zshrc`.\
> Before or after `setgitignore`, write `a.out, test.c, .personal` in separate lines in `~/.gitignore`\
> Don't be shy to reach out for help :)\
> A good practice if you use `Move to Goinfre` is always opening Terminal before any other app when logging in to a different post.\
> Your session is now super fast, and your terminal is incredibly helpful!\
