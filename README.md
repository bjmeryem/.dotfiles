  ### The How-to:

<be>

In your terminal: `git clone git@github.com:bjmeryem/.dotfiles.git && source ~/.dotfiles/zshrc`.
> If you find a warning, fix it by installing what's missing:\
> Use an alias from `~/.zshrc`, then source again. (You can now type: `src` to do so!)\
> After `source ~/.dotfiles/zshrc` is ok, remove `~/.zshrc` and `~/.vimrc`, then execute: the command: `linkvz`.\
> Now you have the configs in the right place, use `rc` to open `~/.zshrc` using Vim, use `vimrc` to open `~/.vimrc`.\
> Explore the aliases on `rc`; use the ones that set or install something (the second alias group).\
> Open `vi test.c`, execute `:PlugInstall` and check that everything is Ok.\
> Write in the test.c file some C code, then save with `:w` to check whether CFormatter42 will work correctly.\
> You can add your configs in $df/.personal, if you wish to keep them separate from `.zshrc`.\
> Before or after `setgitignore`, write `a.out, test.c, .personal` in separate lines in `~/.gitignore`.\
> Don't be shy to reach out for help :).\
> A good practice if you use `Move to Goinfre` is always opening Terminal before any other app when logging in to a different post.\
> Your session is fast now, and your terminal is constructive!
